# Pile Android (Rebuild Workspace)

This directory is reserved for rebuilding Pile as an Android app. The existing
desktop Electron project remains the reference implementation.

## Purpose
- Keep Android-specific work isolated from the Electron codebase.
- Provide a clean workspace for the mobile app architecture and assets.
- Track the end-to-end plan from Phase 0 (inventory) through delivery.

## Where to start
- Phase 0 inventory: `android/plan/phase0-inventory.md`
- Full rollout plan: `android/plan/phase1-to-phase6.md`
- Data model + migration notes: `android/specs/data-model.md`,
  `android/specs/migration.md`
